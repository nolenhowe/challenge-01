# Code Refactor Challenge

## Html and CSS Semantics

- My goal of this project was to replace existing HTML elements to follow a semantic structure
- Doing this allows future developers to better understand the code and track the order flow
- I used outside resources as a guide for using new HTML elements that I had not incorperated before
